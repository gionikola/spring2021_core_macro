# Core Macro III Lab

This repo contains lab materials (and other helpful Julia resources) for David Evans' Spring 2021 PhD Core Macro III course at University of Oregon.

All lab work will be done using Jupyter Notebook.

Materials will be updated and new materials will be posted as we progress into the Spring quarter. I will email the class about all major updates/additions as they happen. You can also stay on top of all changes by frequently pulling from the repo. 

## Week 1

The goal of this lab is to:
- Set up GitHub (to keep track of repo updates);
- Set up our work environment (download and install Julia + Jupyter);
- Cover some Jupyter Notebook basics;
- Cover some Julia basics.

**Note:** Completing the above is crucial for the remaining quarter!

The materials for this week can be found in the `week01` folder, which contains:
- `lab01.ipynb` -- week 1 lab [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gionikola/spring2021_core_macro_lab/blob/main/week01/lab01.ipynb).

You should be able to view rendered versions of both of the above documents by navigating to them here on GitHub.

## Week 2

This lab will cover:
- User-defined functions;
- Loops;
- Linear algebra applications;
- Modeling finite Markov chains.
