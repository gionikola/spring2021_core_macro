# Core Macro III Lab

This repo contains lab materials (and other helpful Julia resources) for David Evans' Spring 2021 PhD Core Macro III course at University of Oregon.

All lab work will be done using Jupyter Notebook.

Materials will be updated and new materials will be posted as we progress into the Spring quarter. I will email the class about all major updates/additions as they happen. You can also stay on top of all changes to the repo independently by creating a GitHub account, installing GitHub Desktop locally on your computer, and then frequently pulling from the repo.
