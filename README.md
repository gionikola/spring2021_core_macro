# Core Macro III Lab

This repo contains lab materials (and other helpful Julia resources) for David Evans' PhD Core Macro III course at University of Oregon.

All lab work will be done using Jupyter Notebook. I recommend installing it along with Atom.

New materials will be posted as we progress into the Spring quarter.
