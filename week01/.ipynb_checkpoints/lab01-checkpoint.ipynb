    "- Download and install Julia;\n",
    "- Download and install Jupyter;\n",
    "- \"Connect\" Jupyter with Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first need to download and install the current stable version of Julia by visiting [this page](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and following the instructions for the appropriate operating system. \n",

    "Then we will need to visit [this page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to download and install Anaconda, which essentially a package management tool that includes Jupyter. To learn more about Anaconda, read the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(Python_distribution)). \n",

    "We then click `Enter` on the keyboard to run the command. This will install the IJulia kernel, which should automatically link Julia with Jupyter. After the installation is complete, we click `Backspace` on the keyboard to leave package mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now type `using IJulia; notebook()` into the REPL to launch Jupyter Notebook. If this running this command leads to an error or the prompt `install Jupyter via Conda, y/n? [y]:`, then we can alternatively launch Jupyter Notebook by finding where it lives on our machine and/or typing `jupyter notebook` into the Anaconda Prompt. In any case, we should see something similar to the following tab open in our web browser (but in a different directory):\n",
